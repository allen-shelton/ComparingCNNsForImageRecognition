# Comparing CNNs Architectures for Visual Impairment Assistive Technology Applications
Visual Impairment is a problem among people of all demographics, and much research hasbeen done to offer people with visual impairment options for safely navigating their environment. The project I am proposing will build upon work that I have already done in this area of research, where I developed a prototype for a deep learning-enabled guide in which a camera recognizes objects using a Convolutional Neural Network, and then a text-to-speech algorithm verbalizes what objects are identified. My project will focus on the CNN portion of that work, and trying to improve the prediction accuracy. The main things that will be explored to improve the accuracy will be the collection of more data, the use of different architectures for transfer learning, and utilizing data augmentation during training.
